# Variational-Quantum-EigeinSolver
The project primarily focuses on the Variational Quantum EigenSolver (VQE) algorithm, which is significant in my bachelor thesis. I had the opportunity to work on this algorithm during my internship at the Phenikaa Institute For Advanced Study with the guidance of Dr. Nguyen Van Duy. It has provided a solid foundation for my current research and serves as a stepping stone for my future endeavors in this field.
